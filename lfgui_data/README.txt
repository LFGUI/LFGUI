This folder contains images that are used by the widgets shipped with LFGUI.
When you look into the code of the widgets, like button and slider, you can
see how these images are used to draw the widgets.
You could use a completly different approach to draw widgets, the used
approach is just one example.

The graphics have been created with Blender and the Blender file (lfgui.blend)
is shipped as well so that it could be used to make different widgets using a
similar approach.
